Project Title:

VIT Bhopal University Absolute Grading Semester CGPA Calculator


Introduction
● Brief context about the importance of CGPA calculation.
● Motivation for automating CGPA calculation specific to VIT Bhopal
University.
● Overview of what the project aims to achieve.


Problem Statement:
● Manual CGPA calculations are difficult due to different course types and
complex grading.
● Errors and inconsistency in manual computations.
● Need for an automated, reliable system to ease student workload.


Description:
My Name is Shivam Singh (25BCE10736) , Student of VIT BHOPAL UNIVERSITY . I
have make a CGPA calculator on absolute grading system of VIT. User will enter
how many no of subject/ courses where there in one semester and based on grades,
grading points, internal ,attendance, mid- term, term end exam marks, it will
calculate the CGPA Course Credits:-
(4 credits, 3credits, 2 credited, 3 credits and 0 credits)

Course type:
Courses are classified into:-
LT - (Lecture tutorials)
LTP- (Lecture tutorial practical)
LP- (lecture practical)
PJ - (project)
P- (practical)

scheme and different types of internal marks

Objectives:
● Develop a Python program to calculate semester CGPA based on user input for
courses, marks, attendance, and credit points.
● VIT Bhopal specific grading rules for different course types (LT, LTP, LP, P,
PJ).
● Provide a user-friendly interface to enter course details and show final CGPA.
● Modularize the code for reusability and
 clarity.



Functional Requirements
● Input total courses, course types, credits, marks, attendance.
● Perform calculations based on VIT grading rules.
● Validate pass/fail eligibility.
● Output marks, grades, grade points, and semester CGPA.
● Allow multiple courses per semester.
Non-functional Requirements
● User-friendly command-line interface.
● Modular, maintainable code.
● Accurate according to university rules.
● Minimum performance overhead.
● Easily extensible for future enhancements.


.
Implementation Approach:
● Use functions to calculate attendance marks, grade points, and total marks
based on course type.
● Use iterative input collection with error checking.
● Calculate CGPA using weighted average formula.
● Code split into Python modules and an interactive Jupyter notebook for main
execution. Tools & Technologies:
● Python 3
● Jupyter Notebook (for interactive demo)
● Git and GitHub (for version control and submission)



System Architecture
● Diagram showing flow between user input, processing modules, and output.
● Modules: Input Handling, Grade Calculation, Attendance Calculation, CGPA
Computation.



Design Diagrams
● Use Case Diagram: Actors (Student) and system interactions (Enter data, get
CGPA).
● Workflow Diagram: Step-wise user input and process flow.
● Sequence Diagram: Interaction between modules/functions during CGPA
calculation.
● Class/Component Diagram: Python modules and their functional relationships.
● ER Diagram: Only if you use file or database storage (optional).



Design Decisions
● Chose modular design for separation of concerns.
● Used CLI for simplicity and wide compatibility.
● Adopted VIT syllabus and grading criteria strictly for accuracy.
● Functions for attendance and grade to facilitate testing.



Implementation Details
● Python 3.8+ used.
● Python modules: attendance.py, grading.py, marks_calculation.py.
● Main interactive program via Jupyter notebook.
● Input validations, error handling.
● Weighted CGPA calculation formula applied.
