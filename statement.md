VIT Bhopal University Absolute Grading Semester CGPA Calculator<br>

Project Statement:-<br>

Problem Statement:-<br>
Calculating semester CGPA manually according to VIT Bhopal University's specific grading schemes is complex due to multiple course types, each with different credit values, attendance requirements, and unique grading patterns. This manual process is prone to errors, takes time, and lacks automation. The project aims to develop an automated Python-based CGPA calculator that accurately computes semester CGPA by incorporating VIT's official rules and simplifies this vital academic task for students.

Scope of the Project:-<br>
•	Automate the semester CGPA calculation using Python based on VIT Bhopal's curriculum norms.<br>
•	Support multiple course types: Lecture Tutorials (LT), Lecture Tutorial Practical (LTP), Lecture Practical (LP), Project (PJ), and Practical (P).<br>
•	Include attendance, assignments, midterm, term-end exams, and lab assessments in marks calculation.<br>
•	Provide a user-friendly interface (using command line or Jupyter Notebook) for inputting course details and marks.<br>
•	Output detailed marks, grade, grade points, and final weighted CGPA.<br>
•	Maintain modular and clear code for easy updates and testing.<br>

Target Users:-<br>
•	VIT Bhopal University students who want an easy and error-free method to calculate semester CGPA.<br>
•	Academic advisors and faculty who want a reference tool for quick grade point calculations.<br>
•	Any student or user following similar university grading schemes interested in learning or using CGPA calculation tools.<br>

High-level Features:-<br>
•	Input total subjects/courses each semester with credit values.<br>
•	Input course-wise marks as per course type and grading norms.<br>
•	Validate marks and eligibility criteria for passing.<br>
•	Compute absolute grades (S, A, B, C, D, E, F) based on course marks.<br>
•	Calculate weighted CGPA using grade points and credits.<br>
•	Output course-wise and semester-wide academic performance summary.<br>
•	Modular code structure for attendance, grading, and marks calculation functions.<br>
